# JSON Placeholder API - Post Management

This project demonstrates the usage of the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) to fetch, filter, and manipulate posts. It contains multiple functions to interact with the data provided by the API. The goal is to showcase how to use asynchronous operations (async/await) to handle API responses and process data.

## Features

This project includes several functions to perform common tasks related to fetching posts from the API. The following operations are implemented:

1. **Fetch all posts**  
2. **Fetch all posts by a specific user ID**  
3. **Fetch a single post by its ID**  
4. **Fetch only 3 posts for a given user ID**  
5. **Fetch a post by its ID and return only the title and userId**  
6. **Update the body content of a post**  
7. **Fetch all posts where the ID is an even number**  
8. **Fetch all posts where the ID is an odd number**  
9. **Calculate the sum of userId and post ID**  
10. **Update the title of a post with an additional string**  
11. **Add a new key (comments) to a post**
